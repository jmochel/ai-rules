rule YAML is structured around pattern-based static analysis, but you can incorporate persona-aligned behavior via:

Descriptive metadata (description, justification, recommendation)

Tags and severity levels

Scoped matching

Embedded process guidelines

Optional enhancements in custom fields or pre/post-processing guidance (even if not natively enforced by Cursor) -->

rules:
  - id: no-system-out
    pattern: System.out.println(...)
    message: Avoid using System.out in production code.
    severity: WARNING
    tags: [java, logging, anti-pattern]
